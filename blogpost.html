            <h1>Ya se acerca noche buena, ya se acerca navidad, 
            para todas las gallinas: el regalo de papá</h1>
            <p>Y este es el párrafo de inicio, debería ser más grande que el título en sí pero 
            weno, jijijijijijijijijijijijij</p>
            <p>Na-na-na-na, na-na
                Na-na-na-na, no
                Yeah, yeah
                Said you loved me but I don't care
                That I broke my hand on the same wall
                That you told me that he fucked you on (oh)
                You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
                I got one comin' over and one right now (oh)
                One right now
                (One right now, one right now, ohh)
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                Said you wanna have my babies
                I fucked you so good, you should pay me
                Don't call me baby when you did me so wrong (you did me so wrong, ooh)
                But I got over what you did already
                Body for body, so petty
                How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
                Bought you a new face, you should call me Dad, baby
                Hermés, but you dropped the bag, baby
                Truth is, maybe one's just not enough
                You say you loved me but I don't care
                That I broke my hand on the same wall
                That you told me that he fucked you on (that he fucked you on)
                You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (feelings)
                I got one comin' over and one right now (oh)
                One right now (hey, hey, hey, hey)
                (One right now, one right now, oh)
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
                (One right now, one right now, ohh)
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                You're a stain in my legacy
                We can't be friends, can't be family (oh)
                You probably fuck all my enemies (ooh)
                I can't let you be next to me, oh
                You belong to the world now
                So just leave me alone now
                We're not in touch no more
                You say you loved me but I don't care (no, I don't care, oh)
                That I broke my hand on the same wall
                That you told me that he fucked you on (oh)
                You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                One right now (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
                (Fuckin' with my, fuckin' with my feelings)
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                (Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
                (One right now)
                I got one comin' over and one right now
                Oh
